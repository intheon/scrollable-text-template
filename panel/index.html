		<p>Late in 2014, Cosworth revealed it was to shift to production and supply of fully validated Power Packages, providing component sets designed and engineered to work together as complete solutions.<br /><br />
		The move allows Cosworth to maximise performance and reliability in its aftermarket products, whilst offering a scalable solution as each subsequent package will integrate seamlessly with its predecessor.</p>

	<div class="panel">

		<p><span style="color: rgb(103,185,232);">Cosworth’s FA20 Power Packages for the Scion FR-S, Subaru BRZ and Toyota GT86 were the first products to be included in this new strategy and have been well-received by the public and media alike.</span> <br /><br />
		A Cosworth-modified Toyota GT86 equipped with the Stage 2.0 Power Package was released onto the market earlier this year and has received positive reviews from some of the UK’s leading automotive journalists.<br /><br />
		Cosworth will halt individual aftermarket component sale at the end of 2015 but will honour outstanding orders and provide a “last time buy” period during which time clients are welcome to buy individual items in stock.</p>
